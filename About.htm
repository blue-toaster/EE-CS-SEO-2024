                    Auckland, also known as Tāmaki Makaurau in Māori, is a bustling metropolitan city situated in the North Island of New Zealand. With an urban population of approximately 1,478,800 as of June 2023, it is part of the greater Auckland Region governed by the Auckland Council. This region encompasses not only urban areas but also rural outskirts and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, totaling a population of 1,739,300 by June 2023. 
                    As New Zealand's most populous city and the fifth largest in Oceania, Auckland has evolved into a multicultural hub over the late 20th century, with Asians making up 31% of its population in 2018. The city boasts the fourth largest foreign-born population globally, with 39% of its residents originating from overseas. 
                    Auckland is home to a significant Pasifika and ethnic Polynesian community, making it the largest Polynesian population center worldwide.

                    Geographically, Auckland is surrounded by natural beauty, bordered by the Hauraki Gulf to the east, Hunua Ranges to the south-east, Manukau Harbour to the south-west, and Waitākere Ranges to the west and north-west. The landscape features lush rainforests and is punctuated by 53 volcanic centers forming the Auckland Volcanic Field. 
                    Positioned on a narrow isthmus between Manukau Harbour and Waitematā Harbour, Auckland stands out as one of the rare cities globally with harbors on two major bodies of water.

                    Established around 1350, Auckland's fertile land attracted early Māori settlements. Following European arrival and British colonization in 1840, William Hobson selected Auckland as New Zealand's capital city. Despite Wellington replacing it as the capital in 1865, Auckland continued to thrive due to its port activities, logging, gold mining in its hinterland, dairy farming in the surrounding regions, and manufacturing within the city. 
                    Today, Auckland's central business district serves as New Zealand's primary economic center and boasts a vibrant cultural scene influenced by its diverse heritage.

                    Home to the largest university in New Zealand - the University of Auckland founded in 1883 - Auckland offers a plethora of tourist attractions including historic sites, festivals, performing arts venues, sports activities, and cultural institutions like the Auckland War Memorial Museum and the Museum of Transport and Technology. 
                    Architectural marvels such as the Harbour Bridge, Town Hall, Ferry Building, and Sky Tower (the Southern Hemisphere's second-tallest building after Thamrin Nine) adorn its skyline. The city is well-connected through Auckland Airport catering to around 2 million international passengers monthly. 
                    Despite its high cost of living, Auckland ranks among the world's most liveable cities; placing third in Mercer's Quality of Living Survey 2019 and clinching first place in The Economist's Global Liveability Ranking for 2021.
